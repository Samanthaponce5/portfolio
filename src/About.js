        <p>
          Hey! Iâ€™m Samantha Ponce, a full-stack developer living in New York.<br/>
          I'm continuously learning new technologies, self-motivated and I'm always<br/>
          looking for something new to challenge myself. I love being creative and problem-solving <br/>
          which is why I love web development. I also love hiking with my dogs and flying drones during my free time.
